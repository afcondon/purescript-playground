# Atelier

*A REPL for agents, with a window for humans.*

**Status:** Phases 1 + 2 shipped; Phase A (post-eval REPL ergonomics) is the current horizon.
**Slug:** `papa-whiskey-uniform-lima` (marginalia id 158 — renamed 2026-04-18 from "PureScript Playground" to "Atelier" after the first live Claude-pair evaluation; slug kept for stability)
**Location:** `/Users/afc/work/afc-work/purescript-playground` (directory name retained; codebase namespace `Playground.*` likewise — rename deferred)
**GitHub:** `afcondon/purescript-playground` (same — Tier 3 rename deferred)
**Parent in marginalia:** WebApps (`victor-xray-golf-bravo`)
**Related:** `ShapedSteer` (sibling vision; patterns flow Atelier → ShapedSteer, not code), `GitHub/trypurescript` (reference only — we drive `purs` ourselves, see the "Compile service — why not trypurescript" note below)

## Vision

A browser-based PureScript scratchpad modelled on Manuel Chakravarty's
*Haskell for Mac*. Three text surfaces in a single live session:

```
┌──────────────────────┬───────────────────────┬──────────────┐
│                      │                       │              │

│                      │                       │              │
└──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

Not a REPL. Everything is in scope of everything else and re-evaluated
continuously as you type. A cell can `let x = …` and the next cell sees
`x`. The user module's top-level bindings are visible to every cell.

Intended audience: two-headed.

1. **Learners** — a better landing than try.purescript.org because you
   can write supporting code in the LHS module and explore it via
   multiple expressions in the playground, all live.
2. **Practised PureScripters** — a REPL-shaped scratchpad that beats the
   actual REPL for working ideas out. Full package set available
   locally; no hunting for the right `import` incantations.

Why it earns its own repo: it's not a visualization showcase, not a
Hylograph lib, and not obviously a subsystem of any other project. It
touches compiler tooling (sidecar for types), package-set hosting, and a
continuous-eval UX — those concerns don't want to live under a sibling.

## Non-goals (for now)

- Not the full Bret Victor surface (no sliders on numbers, no inline
  chart widgets, no direct-manipulation of literals).
- Not a replacement for a PureScript IDE. No go-to-definition, no
  completion, no refactors. Just: edit, eval, see results.
- Not a multi-module project manager. MVP has exactly one user module
  and one playground.
- Not a sharing platform. URL-encoded state is a Phase 3 add-on, not
  MVP.
- Not a tests/QuickCheck runner. HfM shows QuickCheck output because
  Haskell-land leans on it; we can add once the core scratchpad works.

## Relationship to ShapedSteer

ShapedSteer will eventually need very similar infrastructure — a cell
model with results, types, and live re-evaluation. The Playground is
a good place to figure out the **synthesis + scope + result-capture**
pattern without also having to think about typed DAG edges, multiple
executors, and the grid/notebook/timeline views.

We build the Playground standalone. We do **not** invest in making the
playground-eval machinery a shared library. If ShapedSteer wants those
patterns later, we refactor then. Well-structured PureScript refactors
cheaply.

```

Backend and frontend follow the Minard / Marginalia pattern: HTTPurple
backend in its own process, Halogen frontend in its own process, wired
together over HTTP + CORS. We run `spago` / `purs` ourselves against a
modern-tooling workspace checked in at `runtime-workspace/` — no
external compile server, no legacy Dhall tooling in the hot path.

### Compile service — why not trypurescript?

We briefly planned to proxy trypurescript's compile server (a Haskell
binary that wraps `purs` and returns `{ js, warnings }` or `{ errors }`).
Two things changed that plan:

1. Upstream trypurescript (last commit 2023-12-22) still uses
   pre-registry spago with `spago.dhall` / `packages.dhall`. Modern
   `spago` can't build its `staging/` package set, so we'd need a
   modernisation PR just to stand the server up locally.
2. Our backend was already going to own a `purs ide` sidecar, the
   `Main.purs` synthesis, the source-map, and the Worker protocol. The
   trypurescript binary's remaining contribution (spawning `purs`,
   static-serving output, CORS, timeouts) is small in our Node/HTTPurple
   backend.

So we absorbed the compile-server role. A modernisation PR against
upstream trypurescript is now a potential good-citizen follow-up (see
"Stretch — upstream contributions"), not a dependency.

### Compile flow (MVP)

1. User edits the module or any cell.
2. After a ~400ms debounce, the frontend POSTs `{ module, cells }` to
   the backend.
3. Backend synthesizes a single `Main.purs` (see "Synthesis design"
   below) and writes it into `runtime-workspace/src/Main.purs`.
4. Backend shells out to `spago bundle -p playground-runtime --platform browser`
   (or an equivalent `purs compile` + post-processing) against the
   workspace; captures the bundle JS, warnings, and errors.
5. Backend returns `{ js, warnings, errors }` to the frontend.
6. Frontend posts the JS into a Web Worker. The Worker runs it with a
   (say) 3-second timeout and pushes cell-result events back via
   `postMessage`.
7. Frontend renders each cell's result in the gutter, aligned to the
   cell's position.
8. If compilation failed, show the error(s) prominently somewhere
   (MVP = single panel, post-MVP = inline on the originating cell/line).

### Execution model

Web Worker is the execution sandbox. Reasons:

- Infinite loops don't freeze the main thread.
- We can terminate the worker on new compilations or on timeout.
- The `spago bundle` output is a single self-contained browser module;
  no `require` shim needed to pull in library JS at runtime. (If we
  later switch to `purs compile` without bundling for finer control,
  we'll serve `/output/:module/…` as static files over HTTPurple and
  wire up a require-1k shim in the Worker.)

The Worker receives the compiled JS + a list of cell ids. The
synthesized `main` calls a side-channel function we inject (e.g.
`__playground_emit(id, value)`) to publish each cell's result.

## Synthesis design (the core trick)

We compile one module, named `Main`, per keystroke-batch. The trick is
mapping (user module + playground cells) onto that single module such
that:

- Scope semantics match the HfM screenshot (cells see each other and
  the module; later cells see earlier cells).
- Each cell has a stable top-level binding we can evaluate and emit.
- The synthesis is reversible enough for error messages to be mapped
  back to user coordinates.

### Input shape

Frontend submits:

```json
{
  "module": {
    "source": "module Foo where\n\nimport Prelude\n\ndouble x = x * 2\n"
  },
  "cells": [
    { "id": "c1", "kind": "let",  "source": "let quick = quickCheckPure 100" },
    { "id": "c2", "kind": "expr", "source": "double 21" },
    { "id": "c3", "kind": "expr", "source": "map double [1,2,3]" }
  ]
}
```

Cell kinds:

- `expr` — a bare expression, evaluated for its value and type.
- `let` — `let name = rhs` or `name :: T; name = rhs`; binds a name
  visible to later cells but is not itself emitted as a result.

### Synthesised Main.purs

```purescript
module Main where

-- Import user's module verbatim. Its module name gets rewritten to
-- `Playground.User` by the synthesiser so it can always be imported
-- unambiguously regardless of what the user typed at the top of the
-- LHS editor.
import Playground.User

-- (plus whatever `import` lines the user wrote, which we propagate)

import Effect (Effect)
import Effect.Console (log) as PG

-- Foreign runtime hook — provided by the Web Worker environment.
foreign import __playground_emit :: String -> String -> Effect Unit

-- `let`-cells become top-level bindings (kept simple; type inference
-- fills in the signature).
quick = quickCheckPure 100   -- from cell c1

-- `expr`-cells become top-level bindings named by cell id.
cell_c2 = double 21
cell_c3 = map double [1,2,3]

main :: Effect Unit
main = do
  toPlaygroundValue cell_c2 >>= __playground_emit "c2"
  toPlaygroundValue cell_c3 >>= __playground_emit "c3"
```

Notes:

- **User module renamed**: whatever the user typed at the top of the
  LHS editor (`module Foo where`, `module MyExperiment where`, …) is
  rewritten on the server to `module Playground.User where`. User never
  sees this. Keeps the backend deterministic.
- **Cell ids are stable**: frontend assigns them; backend uses them as
  binding names (prefixed `cell_` to dodge keywords).
- **Imports**: module's imports are preserved in the synthesised
  `Main`. Playground cells don't get to `import` — keep the module as
  the place to declare intent.
- **`let` cells** become top-level bindings *without* a synthesised
  `main`-line entry. Their binding is available to later cells.
- **`expr` cells** become top-level bindings AND get a line in `main`
  that shows + emits them.
- **`ToPlaygroundValue` class** dispatches rendering from day one. The
  `main` block above calls `toPlaygroundValue` (returns `Effect String`),
  not bare `show`. That gives us the hook we need to special-case
  `Effect a` values without a two-compile dance.

### Source mapping (Phase 2, but design-aware now)

Compiler errors come back with line/col in the *synthesised* `Main.purs`.
To map back to the user's coordinates we need, per synthesis:

- Per-line map: synthesised line → (surface, line in that surface). A
  surface is "module editor" or "cell c2" etc.
- Column offsets for `let` cells (since we may prefix with `cell_` etc.).

We build this during synthesis and hand it back in the response so the
frontend can attribute errors. MVP can skip this (just show errors in
a panel); implementing it is a Phase 2 task.

### ToPlaygroundValue — the class that makes effects and values look the same

The synthesised `main` calls `toPlaygroundValue` on every cell, never
`show` directly. The class lives in a small `Playground.Runtime` module
that's injected into every compile:

```purescript
class ToPlaygroundValue a where
  toPlaygroundValue :: a -> Effect String

instance ToPlaygroundValue (Effect a) where
  toPlaygroundValue eff = do
    r <- eff
    toPlaygroundValue r
else instance Show a => ToPlaygroundValue a where
  toPlaygroundValue = pure <<< show
```

Instance-chain ordering (`else instance`) resolves the overlap: an
`Effect a` cell runs its effect and recursively renders the result; any
other value with `Show` goes through `show`. HfM's `quickCheck'
prop_revRev` case — a cell of type `Effect String` that should display
`"+++ OK, passed 100 tests."` — is handled by this chain without any
type-directed synthesis gymnastics on the backend.

In Phase 2 we extend `ToPlaygroundValue` with richer instances (records,
arrays of structured data, `Maybe`/`Either`, etc.) rendered via Sigil
rather than plain `show`. The class is the extension point — we're not
locked into `String` forever; `toPlaygroundValue` can return a
`Sigil`-renderable intermediate once Phase 2 is in flight.

## Type rendering

Types are rendered via **purescript-sigil**. It takes a PureScript type
signature string and produces a typographically nice DOM rendering
(see `/Users/afc/work/afc-work/purescript-hylograph-libs/purescript-sigil/`).

The type sidecar is a long-lived **`purs ide server`** subprocess,
managed by the backend:

- On startup, backend launches `purs ide server` pointed at a
  workspace directory.
- On each compile, the synthesised `Main.purs` is written to that
  workspace so `purs ide` sees it.
- Backend queries `purs ide` for the type of each `cell_cN` binding
  (and for the names of `let`-cells) via the standard
  `{ "command": "type", ... }` protocol.
- `purescript-language-cst-parser` is used on the synthesised module to
  enumerate cell identifiers authoritatively, so the backend doesn't
  have to trust its own synthesis record.

This is heavier than reading externs, but `purs ide` is the same
infrastructure we'd want for hover-types, completion, and
go-to-definition later — it pays forward. Sidecar returns
`{ types: { c2: "Int", c3: "Array Int", … } }` to the frontend; the
frontend hands each type string to Sigil.

Because we're committing to `purs ide` from day one, we should decide
whether inline types land in Phase 1 (if the sidecar is running
anyway) or stay Phase 2. See Open Decisions.

## Phase 1 — MVP

**Goal:** the scratchpad works end-to-end and looks like HfM —
a module, a column of cells, and a gutter that shows both the value
and the inferred type for each cell, all updating live.

- Edit a module and a sequence of cells.
- See each cell's rendered value (via `ToPlaygroundValue`) update live.
- See each cell's inferred type rendered by Sigil in the gutter.
- `Effect a` cells auto-run and display the result.
- See compile errors in a panel when the code doesn't compile.

**In scope:**

- Halogen frontend, CM6 editors (two: module, cells).
- HTTPurple backend that synthesises `Main.purs`, shells out to `spago
  bundle` against `runtime-workspace/`, and manages a `purs ide`
  subprocess for type queries.
- `purescript-language-cst-parser` on the backend to enumerate cell
  identifiers for type lookup.
- Web Worker execution with timeout.
- `ToPlaygroundValue` class injected into every compile (instance
  chain: `Effect a` first, `Show a` second).
- Sigil rendering of each cell's inferred type in the gutter.
- `show`-based (via `ToPlaygroundValue`) result rendering alongside
  types in the gutter.
- `expr` cells and `let` cells.
- Single user module, hard-coded starter content on first load.
- Full package set in `runtime-workspace/spago.yaml`, pinned to
  `registry: 73.3.0`, curated on our own cadence. Broad starter deps
  (`prelude`, `effect`, `console`, `aff`, `arrays`, `foldable-traversable`,
  `maybe`, `tuples`, `strings`, `integers`, `numbers`, `ordered-collections`,
  `random`, plus a dose of `halogen`-adjacent stuff if we want UI demos).

**Out of scope (Phase 1):**

- No inline error attribution (just show the error text in a panel).
- No richer value rendering (plain `show`-style strings for values;
  Sigil-rendered records/arrays/etc. is Phase 2).
- No URL sharing, no multi-module, no file tree.
- No login, no persistence.

## Phase 2 — Inline error attribution, richer value rendering

- [x] Source map so compiler errors get attributed to the originating
      surface (module / which cell). Landed 2026-04-17: structured
      `CompileError` with optional `Position`, `CellRange` per expr
      cell, frontend error panel renders "cell c2 ▸ line 1".
- [x] `ToPlaygroundValue` instances for richer structures (`Maybe`,
      `Either`, `Tuple`, nested arrays) that render structurally
      rather than plain `show`. Landed 2026-04-18: `PlaygroundValue`
      ADT on the wire, `Playground.Frontend.ValueView` walks the
      tree, constructors get accent colour and parenthesised args.
      Records landed 2026-04-18 via `RowToList` — `PVRecord` case,
      renders in `{ field: value }` PureScript surface syntax.
      Nullary constructors (`Africa`, `LT`, `Nothing`) landed same
      day via a Show-output heuristic — bare upper-case identifiers
      get emitted as `PVCtor s []` uniformly with hand-written
      instances. Multi-arg user ADTs without a hand-written
      instance still fall to `PVRaw` (Generic-based fallback
      deferred — see EVAL-NOTES).
- [x] Warnings surfaced (same panel, amber treatment). Landed
      2026-04-17.
- [x] Hover-type popovers on identifiers inside the editors. Landed
      2026-04-18: CM6 `hoverTooltip` fetches from `/ide/type`;
      tooltip content is Sigil-rendered (typographic layout for
      polymorphic signatures like `map`).

## Phase 2 follow-ups (practitioner polish, landed 2026-04-18)

- [x] Colour-coded cells threaded from editor through gutter —
      8-slot Swiss palette, position-based.
- [x] `Aff a` support — `ToPlaygroundValue` class now returns
      `Aff PlaygroundValue`; synthesised `main` uses `launchAff_`.
- [x] `let`-cell UI toggle — per-cell [expr | let] button,
      gutter filters expr-only, colour index preserved.
- [x] Wider default runtime-workspace package set — practitioner
      deps (transformers, parsing, argonaut, affjax, nullable, st,
      etc.) available for user imports without edits to the
      workspace.
- [x] User imports mirrored into synthesised Main — cells see the
      same scope the user's module does.
- [x] Tailscale-reachable: backend binds to `0.0.0.0`, frontend
      resolves backend URL from `window.location.hostname`.
- [x] Inline error decoration on the CM6 editor — `errorsField`
      StateField + `setErrorsEffect` StateEffect paint red squiggles
      on the offending cell/line; errors are partitioned by
      filename (module vs cell) and remapped from Main-relative
      lines to cell-relative using `cellRanges`.
- [x] Records and nullary constructors as structured values — see
      Phase 2's ToPlaygroundValue bullet above.
- [x] Monads-crossing starter content — `monadsCross` exercises
      Maybe / Array / Either / Tuple via the structural renderer;
      `monadsWithAff` for async; `erlangProcesses` for Purerl
      actors.

### Still queued (post-MVP polish, optional)

- A proper PureScript grammar for CM6 (currently using the legacy-
  modes Haskell mode; good enough but not PureScript-exact).
- Generic-based `ToPlaygroundValue` for multi-arg user ADTs —
  records and nullary ctors are already structured; this would
  close the loop for `data Result = Ok Int | Err String` and
  similar. Deferred because PureScript instance chains don't fall
  through on constraint failure cleanly.
- Session mutex + IDE-query reliability: timeout + finally bracket
  landed 2026-04-18; still open is whether to proactively
  health-check the `purs ide` server rather than relying on
  per-query timeouts.

## Post-eval evolution (Phases A–E)

Phases 3 and 4 as originally sketched are superseded by what the
2026-04-18 Claude-pair evaluation revealed
([CLAUDE-PAIR-EVAL-2026-04-18.md](./CLAUDE-PAIR-EVAL-2026-04-18.md)).
The old "Phase 4 Claude panel" — a chat sidebar where the human
accepts/rejects Claude's edits — is dropped: the HTTP API *is* the
channel between agent and system, and the reframe to "REPL for
agents with a window for humans" makes the sidebar superfluous. Old
Phase 3's items (persistence, multi-module, export) survive but
reshuffled across the phases below. Lettered A–E to signal the
pivot point from "build the MVP" to "evolve the useful tool we now
have."

Phases are ordered by dependency depth, not calendar. A compounds
the agent's existing workflows (days); B opens a new output
dimension (weeks); C is an architectural shift (weeks); D can run
parallel to C; E is the longest horizon.

Forward-looking ideas that haven't been assigned a phase yet
(sidecar UI delivery, `purs ide rebuild` as a perf lever,
content-addressed cell IDs) live in
[EVAL-NOTES.md](./EVAL-NOTES.md) under the 2026-04-19 section.

### Phase A0 — Architectural prerequisite: Aff-isolated editor

Uncovered 2026-04-19 while attempting a Drive/Observe frontend
toggle (to let the human "grab the conch" and stop the frontend's
auto-compile racing with the agent's API writes). The toggle
itself is a tiny feature, but implementing it exposed a livelock
in the existing editor↔Shell coupling: clicking into the editor
in Drive mode + typing hung the whole app. Pausing the debugger
caught the Aff scheduler (`run3` / par-trampoline) busy in
different locations each time — classic livelock, not deadlock.

The attempt was reverted; this section captures the refactor
needed before Drive/Observe (or any lock protocol between
parent and editor) can be re-attempted safely.

#### The problem: Input-as-sync

Today the Editor is a Halogen child component. Its CM6 view is
driven by:

- **Down**: `Shell` re-renders on state change, passes a new
  `Input { initialDoc, tag }` to the `HH.slot _moduleEditor`.
  Editor's `receive` handler fires `UpdateInput`, which compares
  `input.initialDoc` against its own `currentDoc`. On mismatch it
  calls `CM.setContent`, which dispatches a doc-replace
  transaction into the CM6 view.
- **Up**: on user typing, CM6's `updateListener` fires
  `onChange(newContent)`. Editor's `HandleChange` action sets
  `currentDoc` and raises `Changed`. Shell handles it as
  `ModuleChanged`, stamps an edit, modifies `moduleSource`,
  schedules a debounced compile.

This is cheap *when nothing else is writing*, but the sync
mechanism is the `Input` record itself: Halogen's re-render
behaviour determines when `receive` fires, and the Editor's
reconciliation (setContent on mismatch) can — under the right
ordering — feed its own `onChange` back through the parent.
Fragile. The 2026-04-19 livelock was exactly this: a re-render
cascade where each `setContent` from a mid-action state update
re-triggered `onChange` → `ModuleChanged` → another state update
→ another re-render → another `setContent`, ad infinitum.

#### The target: Editor as an Aff-owned service

The fix is to stop using `Input` as the sync channel. Instead:

- The Editor owns the CM6 view and the authoritative doc string.
  It is a long-lived Aff service (a fiber, or an Aff process
  started during `Initialise`) — the Shell does **not** touch
  the view directly through re-renders.
- Communication between Shell and Editor is only through
  explicit message channels: two `AVar`s (or an `HS.Emitter` pair,
  or a queue abstraction). The wire types are explicit:
  - **ShellToEditor** messages (Shell requests the Editor to do
    something): `ReplaceDoc String`, `SetEditable Boolean`,
    `SetErrors (Array ErrorSpan)`. Sent via an outbound AVar the
    Editor reads.
  - **EditorToShell** messages (the Editor notifies Shell of user
    activity): `UserTyped String`. Sent via an inbound AVar the
    Shell subscribes to.
- Halogen's `Input` becomes a configuration bootstrap only —
  passed on mount, never used as an ongoing sync mechanism. No
  `receive`-driven reconciliation.
- Only one writer at a time is allowed to mutate the doc:
  - When the human is typing (local input), the Editor owns the
    doc; Shell requests (`ReplaceDoc`) are buffered or rejected
    until the user pauses.
  - When the agent's write lands (via SSE or poll), Shell sends
    `ReplaceDoc`; Editor updates its view and emits
    `UserTyped` only for genuine *user* input, not for doc
    changes it applied itself.

This mirrors a proper actor/CSP pattern: each party has a single
inbox, writes are linearised, and no loop can form because no
party reacts to its own emissions.

#### Concrete shape

```
                 ┌─────────────────┐
                 │      Shell      │

                 │    editable     │
                 └─────────────────┘
```

- `ShellToEditor` is a buffered channel (multiple writes collapse
  into the latest, so a burst of agent writes doesn't queue).
- `EditorToShell` is a strict queue (every keystroke matters).
- The Editor fiber's main loop: `forever $ race takeShellToEditor
  waitForCMUpdate >>= applyOrForward`.

#### What this unblocks

- **Drive/Observe toggle** re-lands as Shell sending
  `SetEditable Boolean`; no FFI Compartment fiddling needed at
  the call site, because `SetEditable` is a regular message and
  the Editor fiber applies it cleanly between its other work.
- **Multi-client conch protocol** (multiple Claudes + human
  races): the Shell↔Editor channel becomes the model for a
  broader **Session↔Driver** channel. `POST /session/lock` with
  client-ids becomes feasible because we already have the
  discipline of "only one party can write, requests are
  linearised."
- **Sidecar mode** (EVAL-NOTES 2026-04-19): if the editor lives
  in the user's editor-of-choice instead of in Atelier, the
  Editor fiber abstraction lets us swap the CM6-owning fiber for
  a file-watching fiber without the Shell noticing.

#### Open questions (to resolve during design, not now)

- `AVar` vs `HS.Emitter` vs custom Queue — which gives us
  collapse-to-latest on the Shell→Editor side? May need a tiny
  `LatestRef` helper.
- Does the Editor fiber run inside Halogen's `HalogenM` (via
  `subscribe`) or outside it (raw `Aff.forkAff`)? Halogen-inside
  is more idiomatic; raw Aff is freer but loses Halogen's
  subscription cleanup.
- How do we express "the Editor is still initialising" in the
  message shape? Send a `Ready` message first? Buffer Shell→Editor
  until `Ready`?

#### What this doesn't change

The Halogen Shell still owns everything non-editor (runtime
selector, compile state, errors panel, cells list structure,
poll timer). Only the Editor component is re-architected. The
HTTP API surface is untouched.

### Phase A — Finish the agent REPL's ergonomics

Pure additions, no architectural change. Closes the practitioner
friction other Claude flagged in the eval.

- `PATCH /session/module` — structured edits: `{addImport: "X"}`,
  `{appendBody: "..."}`, `{replaceRange: {startLine, endLine, text}}`.
  Replaces the current full-body POST for small changes; kills the
  "GET, string-replace in Python, POST back" lurch.
- `POST /session/export` + `POST /session/import`, plus
  `GET /sessions` history. First-class checkpointing; eliminates the
  hand-rolled `checkpoint.json`/`replay.py` reflex.
- `GET /session/types` — narrow read for tight type-checking loops
  where `js` (~80KB) is pure overhead.
- Doc additions: shell-quoting warning (`\` in POST bodies, Python
  raw-string prefix), let-cell composability example, the emit wire
  format (already landed in CLAUDE-PAIR.md).
- Browser-runtime evaluator-liveness signal: surface in the snapshot
  whether a tab is actually evaluating, so the agent doesn't wait
  on emits that will never arrive.

Done in this phase: session state remains a single in-memory
`SessionStore` with the AVar-mutex + finally-bracket we added on
2026-04-18.

### Phase B — Human observatory: dual-axis output

Open the pluggable render pane. Keep the type axis we already have
(`types: [{id, signature}]`), add a representations axis (Jupyter's
MIME idea, minus the type-flattening sin).

Phase B representations are **cell-kind declared**, not
**type-inferred**. That is: a cell is marked `kind: svg` or
`kind: hats` or `kind: canvas`, and its source returns something
appropriate for that representation. Explicit is legible to the
agent ("this cell emits SVG") and avoids the design-cost of a
type-driven mime-dispatch upfront. If we later want type-driven
representations (records get a table view automatically, etc.),
promote the machinery from cell-kind to type-indexed without
breaking the wire format.

**The representation tag does double duty.** It's both a *render
contract* (the viz pane knows how to display `image/svg+xml`)
and a *wiring contract* — a future DAG cell consuming
`text/x-bar-chart-data+json` plugs into anything producing it,
*regardless of the underlying PureScript type*. PureScript type
is the cell's *internal* implementation; representation tag is
the *interchange* type. Two cells with different PS types can
both produce `text/x-graph+json` and be DAG-compatible without
sharing a typeclass — they share a *representation*. Phase B is
therefore not just "add a viz pane" — it's introducing the type
system the Phase E (ShapedSteer-inspired) DAG will run on.
Probably wants a registered namespace
(`application/x-hylograph.bar-chart-data+json` or similar) plus
pluggable renderers + codecs per representation.

- Values optionally carry
  `representations :: Array { mime :: String, data :: String }`
  alongside the existing `emits` field.
- Initial backends: `text/html`, `image/svg+xml`, `text/x-hats+json`
  (Hylograph AST for native integration with the rest of the
  ecosystem), `application/x-canvas-ops` (a log of 2D canvas calls
  for replay).
- Fourth pane in the UI: swappable based on the active cell's
  representations and what the pane's renderer supports. When no
  representation is available, falls back to the existing
  values+types gutter.
- Agent still reads the underlying data from `emits`; the render
  pane is purely for the human. Both sides see what they need.
- "Promote cell → module function" affordance lands here — it's
  render-agnostic and belongs with the "move work out of the
  scratchpad into real code" theme.

### Phase C — Streaming / effectful things in the world

Shift from one-shot emit to multi-emit-over-time. Biggest lift in
the plan; touches backend adapter, wire protocol, and UI.

- SSE stream from backend (`GET /session/events`, already sketched
  in CLAUDE-PAIR.md); each event carries a `{cellId, value, at}`
  triple. Cells can emit repeatedly; render pane animates; agent
  reads the trace as structured data.
- Long-lived cells: a cell's synthesised top-level binding can be
  an `Aff Unit` or Erlang process that emits as state evolves,
  rather than a single value. The runtime `emit` FFI is already a
  per-call channel; this is mostly scheduler plumbing.
- Use cases this unlocks: Lorenz attractor stepping, MIDI trace,
  Erlang actor mailbox, reactive layout convergence, network
  request timelines.
- Agent-facing: read the full trace via a `GET /session/trace/:id`
  endpoint that returns the cell's emit history. The agent can
  reason about process behaviour, not just final state.

### Phase D — Multi-module + project-binding

Can run parallel to Phase C; different dependency set.

- `POST /session/modules/:name`, `DELETE /session/modules/:name`.
  Cells and other modules can `import` across them. The synthesis
  pipeline generalises: one `Main.purs` splices cells from multiple
  user modules instead of one `Scratch`.
- Project-context binding: attach a Playground session to an
  existing PureScript project's spago workspace. Package set comes
  from the project; top-level identifiers from the project appear
  in scope; `purs ide` repoints to the project's output directory.
- Promote cell → project source tree: agent-mediated (it has the
  context for naming and placement). Closes the loop where the
  Playground is a staging surface and the agent carries cells into
  real code.

### Phase E — Inspiration for ShapedSteer

The reframe to "REPL for agents" makes the Playground look like the
simplest useful configuration of what ShapedSteer is aiming at
(typed DAG workbench, multiple executors, multiple views). But we
don't *grow the Playground into* ShapedSteer — ShapedSteer gets
built fresh with its own architecture, and the Playground serves
as a working, feature-rich reference to lift code and patterns
from.

What transfers cleanly:

- Session-state shape (module + cells + derived types + derived
  values) as a starting schema for DAG nodes.
- Adapter abstraction (browser / node / purerl) as a template for
  ShapedSteer's multiple executors; adding "human input" and "AI"
  executor cell-kinds is a natural extension there.
- The Phase B representation system *is* the wiring vocabulary.
  Today's Atelier cell is the degenerate case of a ShapedSteer
  node — implicit scope (whatever the module exports), no
  declared inputs, single output. ShapedSteer adds declared
  typed inputs to each cell, and the representation tags from
  Phase B become the type system that wiring runs on. The
  `ToPlaygroundValue` + MIME-representations machinery transfers
  directly.
- The Claude-pair HTTP API surface as a proof that
  agent-driven-by-default works; ShapedSteer's analogue of this is
  probably bigger surface but same shape.
- Reliability patterns: AVar mutex + finally-bracket, process
  timeouts, on-exit respawn of shared subprocesses.

What we leave behind (don't port): the single-`Scratch` assumption,
the synthesised-`Main.purs` trick (ShapedSteer won't compile one
splat per cell-set; it'll compile a proper DAG), the
cells-as-untyped-sources model (ShapedSteer cells have declared
typed inputs and outputs, not implicit name-based deps).

### Design principles we preserve across all phases

Invariants from the original plan, still load-bearing:

- **Session state is a serialisable value**, not UI state scattered
  across Halogen components. Enables export/import, replay, and
  the whole agent round-trip model.
- **Compile results carry structured errors**, not rendered
  strings. `purs --json-errors` format all the way through; don't
  flatten on the way to the frontend.
- **Cell ids are stable across edits.** Types and values correlate
  by id; polling and streaming both depend on this.
- **Edits round-trip through the compile/eval loop.** Agent's POST
  becomes the human's observed state; no separate edit-preview
  path that can drift from reality.

### Explicitly not on the path

- **Cloning Jupyter.** We keep the MIME-dispatch idea for
  representations (Phase B), but the type axis is first-class and
  distinct from representations — not flattened into
  `application/json`.
- **A "Claude panel" chat sidebar in the browser UI.** The old
  Phase 4 idea. Superseded by the agent-REPL framing: the HTTP API
  *is* the channel.
- **Learner-oriented features.** Practitioner audience only; agents
  are the other side of the practitioner relationship. Not a
  learning tool.

## Starter content

What the user sees on first load (hard-coded in the frontend for MVP):

**Module editor**

```purescript
module Scratch where

import Prelude

double :: Int -> Int
double x = x * 2
```

**Playground cells**

```
double 21
map double [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let xs = 1..10
sum (map double xs)
```

Zero library imports beyond `Prelude`. `double 21` is the liveness
smoke test — change the `2` in the module to `3`, see the cell jump
to `63`. `let xs = 1..10` demonstrates a `let`-cell binding visible
to the cell below it. Enough shape to communicate the model in a
single screen; nothing the user has to install or understand first.

## Positioning beyond MVP

Captured 2026-04-18 — the framing that crystallised once the MVP was
in front of us in Chrome. This is forward-looking; what's actually
implemented is the MVP described in Phase 1.

### Primary framing (post-eval, 2026-04-18): a REPL for agents with a window for humans

After the first live Claude-pair evaluation
([CLAUDE-PAIR-EVAL-2026-04-18.md](./CLAUDE-PAIR-EVAL-2026-04-18.md)),
the right one-liner for what we're building is:

> **A REPL for agents, with a window for humans.**

Each piece earns its place:

- **REPL** — typed input → stateful workspace → read-back. Cells are
  prompts; the module is scope; `/ide/type` is `:t`; snapshot-on-write
  is the read-back. The primitive shape is genuinely a REPL, just
  structured and HTTP-addressable.
- **For agents** — the HTTP API is the primary user interface, not a
  secondary scripting layer. A Claude session is the one doing most
  of the writing. Feature prioritisation follows from this: other
  Claude's quick-wins (PATCH module, export/import, structured
  record/ADT emits) are core REPL ergonomics for an agent, not polish.
- **With a window for humans** — the browser UI is a transparent
  observation pane, not a peer seat. The render column, the inline
  error squiggles, and type-rendering typography are all *for the
  human watching* what the agent is doing; they aren't where the
  human drives from.

This reverses the earlier "pair programming" metaphor's implication of
two peers. There is one driver (the agent) and one observer (the
human), though the human retains full authority and can interrupt.

**Human input still matters — in the form best suited to humans.**
Not volume but direction: pseudo-signatures sketched in English,
ADT proposals phrased as descriptions, design-level constraints, the
"no, that's the wrong shape" call. Claude will write far more code
than any human can match or fully review line-by-line, so the human's
contribution is intent, taste, and veto — expressed in the vocabulary
the human is fastest in (English, hand-drawn types, rough sketches).
Translating those into compilable PureScript is the agent's job.

This reframe shapes the rest of this section: the existing "two
practitioner use cases," the AI-mediated-lift argument, and the
Claude-panel Phase 4 are all *downstream* of this one-liner. Keep
them — they're still true — but read them under this header.

### Two practitioner use cases (no learners)

We initially imagined a learner audience alongside the practitioner
one. Dropping that. Both modes assume PureScript fluency and target
practitioners:

- **(A) Live scratchpad** — the HfM-modelled environment we shipped:
  module + cells + per-cell types + per-cell values, live recompile,
  Web Worker execution, dedicated error panel.
- **(B) AI collaboration around design-by-types** — the Claude-panel
  direction (Phase 4 below). Not "AI helps you write code." The
  framing that emerged in conversation: PureScript starts to feel
  like a *high-level assembly language* — Claude writes the
  implementations, the human operates at the type-design level. Types
  become the negotiation surface; cells become design probes that
  ground the design in concrete behaviour.

Dropping the learner framing frees up real things: we can show full
structural error output, surface `purs ide` features verbatim
(hover, completion, search-by-type), assume `Show` and the type
system are vocabulary the user already has.

### Rapid development environment with AI-mediated lift

The historical killer of scratchpad culture (Smalltalk workspaces,
Lisp listeners, IPython, even REPL-driven workflows) was the *transfer
tax*: figure something out interactively, then rewrite it in the real
codebase with proper structure, types, tests, naming. AI capabilities
make that tax near-zero — a sketched cell can be promoted into a
properly-shaped module in some target project, named per project
conventions, with tests stubbed and deps added to that project's
`spago.yaml`. The Playground becomes a *staging surface*, not a
terminal destination.

Architectural consequences worth designing toward now:

- A **promote** affordance: select cells → pick a target project →
  lift code into that project's source tree. Probably Claude-mediated
  (it has the context to do project-aware naming and placement).
- **Project-context binding** — a Playground instance can attach to a
  project: package set drawn from that project's `spago.yaml`,
  top-level identifiers from that project in scope, promote landing
  by default in that project. Without this, the Playground is a
  sandbox; with it, it's an extension of an existing codebase.

### Runtime substrate is pluggable

Today: `spago bundle` for browser, executed in a Web Worker. But the
synthesis pipeline (module + cells → `Main.purs`) is runtime-agnostic.
Two natural alternates:

- **Node host** — same JS bundle, run in a Node `child_process`
  instead of a Worker. Now user code can hit FS, sockets, DBs, native
  modules. A scratchpad for backend-PS development. Emit protocol can
  be richer (capture stdout, stream long-running effects).
- **Purerl host** — different spago backend (`purerl`), bundles to
  BEAM, backend supervises an Erlang process. A typed scratchpad with
  real OTP execution — interactive design for fault-tolerant systems.

Either is "swap the runtime adapter," not a rewrite. **As of
2026-04-18 the adapter abstraction is in place** — `Playground.Server.Adapter`
declares the contract; `Playground.Server.Adapter.BrowserWorker` is the
first impl. Adding Node or Purerl is one new file pair plus a router
wire-up.

#### A switchable demo as the anchor goal

A strong public demo: a single playground UI with a "runtime: PureScript /
Purerl" switch in the header. Same module, same cells, same gutter; one
side runs your code on V8 in a Worker, the other ships it to BEAM in an
Erlang process and reads back results. *try.purescript.org and
try.purerl.org rolled into one*, with feature parity and the Sigil-
rendered types working in both. Frames the project not as "trypurescript
successor" alone but as "the typed-functional scratchpad," with the host
runtime as a first-class choice.

This validates the adapter abstraction, gives the Purerl ecosystem a
Playground it has never had, and is a clean way to introduce the
project to either community.

### Edges of the system as the AI-collaboration sweet spot

Where the AI-collaboration mode pays the most: the *edges* of a
system, not the pure-internal logic. Sockets, DBs, FS, AJAX, GraphQL,
SQL — places where the human wants to supervise the interpretation
of stuff coming in from outside. Those edges are also where types do
their best work (parsing, schema, codecs). Likely runtime-workspace
deps to add as we move that direction:

- `argonaut` / `codec-argonaut` — JSON codecs (already in)
- `affjax` — HTTP client
- `node-fs` — filesystem (Node host only)
- `httpurple` — HTTP server (Node host)
- A typed Postgres client — Mark Eibes' `postgres-om` (or whatever
  the current name is) for SQL with compile-time schema checks
- `purescript-graphql` if/when GraphQL becomes interesting

The pattern is consistent: a typed interface on top of a messy edge,
exercised through cells that probe the edge's behaviour, with Claude
proposing and refining types as the boundary's shape becomes clearer.

## Trajectory — replace trypurescript.org

Updated stance (2026-04-18). Rather than filing a modernisation PR
against the legacy trypurescript repo, the Playground grows into its
successor. Reasons: it starts with all the things trypurescript needs
anyway (modern spago, registry-pinned package set, structured JSON
response, typed client), plus the things trypurescript doesn't have
(per-cell types + values, Sigil-rendered signatures, Web Worker
sandbox, AI-collaboration substrate). Core-team reception is
expected to be supportive given the project is open-source and fills
the same role with a better foundation.

What this requires beyond MVP:

- **Performance parity-or-better with trypurescript's hot-path
  compile**. Today we shell `spago bundle` on every edit; that's
  ~100ms warm but grows with imports. The "compile Main only + link
  precompiled library chunks" model trypurescript uses (a `require`
  shim in the Worker pulling `/output/:module/…` served statically)
  is the right target. Bundle size stays fixed, only Main.purs +
  Playground.User.purs recompile per keystroke.
- **Feature parity with trypurescript's public surface**: URL-encoded
  shareable state (`code=`), GitHub gist + repo loading (`gist=`,
  `github=`), view-mode switching (code / output / both),
  JS-code-generation toggle (`js=true`). Most of these live in the
  Phase 3 block; the successor framing moves them from "nice to
  have" to "table stakes."
- **A hosted instance at a production-quality URL** — either taking
  over `try.purescript.org` (core-team conversation) or launching at
  a Hylograph-owned URL first and earning the redirect.
- **Operational hygiene**: rate limits, sandboxed compile pool,
  auth-free but abuse-resistant. The backend already owns the
  compile invocations, so this is a backend-layer concern.

None of this blocks us from shipping the practitioner + AI-collab
modes for local use; it's what turns the local tool into a hosted
successor.

### Original trypurescript — what still makes sense

- **Lessons flow outward, not back**: if the Playground's synthesis
  pipeline or `ToPlaygroundValue` design is useful elsewhere, we lift
  it to a library (likely in `purescript-hylograph-libs`) rather than
  patching the legacy repo.
- **A courtesy PR** to trypurescript pointing at the successor once
  it's ready, probably in the README, so folks finding the old repo
  know where to go.

## Stretch — the Bret Victor corner

If and only if Phases 1–3 land and still want more:

- Hover over an `Int` literal → slider to scrub values and see results
  update live.
- Hover over a list/array of numbers → small plot inline.
- Hover over a typed function value → table of inputs/outputs.
- None of this is committed-to; it's where the "useful contribution to
  the ecosystem" idea can reach further.

## Decisions

Locked in (2026-04-17):

- **Effect-cell handling** — `ToPlaygroundValue` class with an
  instance chain (`Effect a` first, `Show a` second). Dispatch from
  day one; cells of type `Effect a` auto-run and render the result.
- **Type sidecar** — `purs ide server` subprocess managed by the
  backend. Heavier than externs-file reads, but reusable for hover
  types, completion, and go-to-definition in later phases.
- **Editor framework** — CodeMirror 6. More client plumbing than
  lifting an existing Ace-based editor, but the inline-widget APIs
  are essential for the result gutter.
- **Backend process model** — one Playground backend process (HTTPurple,
  Node), which owns the compile workspace and shells out to `spago` /
  `purs` on demand. No separate compile-server sibling process.
- **Inline types in Phase 1** — yes. Since the `purs ide` sidecar is
  running from day one, the MVP shows the cell's inferred type in the
  gutter (rendered by Sigil) alongside the value.
- **Starter content** — a minimal `double x = x * 2` module and three
  cells that exercise it. Prelude-only, no library imports. Loads fast
  and demonstrates shared-scope liveness in the first keystroke.
- **Package set + compile service** — `runtime-workspace/` inside this
  repo is a modern-tooling spago workspace pinned to
  `packageSet: { registry: 73.3.0 }`. The Playground backend drives
  `purs` / `spago` against it directly. trypurescript is no longer a
  runtime dependency; the upstream repo is reference material only,
  and modernising it is a potential good-citizen PR (Stretch).
- **Repo layout** — `frontend/` + `server/` + `shared/` + `runtime-workspace/`
  at the root, matching Minard conventions for the first three. Root
  `Makefile` for orchestration.
- **Visibility** — public GitHub repo from day one, but unadvertised
  (not linked from the polyglot site, blog, Discord, etc.) until MVP
  ships. Rough commits are fine; they just don't get promoted.

## Open decisions

(None remaining. All pre-implementation decisions are locked above.
New questions will land here as they surface during M0–M6.)

## Task list / rough milestones

**M0 — scaffolding (half day)**

- [x] Initialise public (but unadvertised) git repo on GitHub.
- [x] `frontend/` (Halogen + CM6), `server/` (HTTPurple), `shared/`
      (codecs/types) skeletons at the root, matching Minard. Root
      `Makefile` orchestrates builds.
- [x] Register marginalia server entries for the frontend and backend
      processes once each has a known-good start command.
- [ ] Scaffold `runtime-workspace/`: modern `spago.yaml` pinned to
      `registry: 73.3.0`, a broad starter-dependency list, and a
      placeholder `src/Main.purs` (covered by M1's first task).

**M1 — compile round-trip (1–2 days)**

- [x] Runtime workspace: hard-coded `Main.purs` that prints
      `"hello from runtime-workspace"`; verify `spago bundle -p
      playground-runtime --platform browser` produces a runnable
      browser bundle.
- [x] Backend `/session/compile` that, for now, ignores the request
      body, rewrites a fixed `Main.purs` into `runtime-workspace/src/Main.purs`,
      shells out to `spago bundle`, and returns `{ js, warnings, errors }`.
- [x] Verify the workspace's full package set is reachable: a compile
      that `import`s e.g. `Data.Array` should succeed.
- [x] Frontend posts a fixed payload and renders the JS as text in a
      pane. No execution yet.

**M2 — synthesis from user input (2–3 days)**

- [x] Two CM6 editors on the frontend (module + cells).
- [x] Cell list data model + add/remove cell UI (single column for
      now, one cell per editor instance).
- [x] `Playground.Runtime` module shipped with every compile, defining
      `ToPlaygroundValue` with the `Effect a` / `Show a` instance chain
      and the `__playground_emit` foreign import. (Lives in
      `runtime-workspace/src/Playground/Runtime.purs`; imported by
      every synthesised Main.)
- [x] Backend synthesiser: user module → `Playground.User`, cells →
      top-level bindings, synthesised `main` calling
      `toPlaygroundValue` + `__playground_emit`.
- [x] End-to-end: edit, debounce, submit, compile, display JS.

**M3 — execution in a Worker (2 days)**

- [x] Web Worker that accepts compiled JS, executes `main`,
      collects emissions via a registered `__playground_emit` hook.
      (Spun up from a Blob URL — no static `/worker.js` file needed.)
- [x] Require-shim skipped — `spago bundle` produces a single
      self-contained IIFE, so no library JS needs to be pulled in at
      runtime.
- [x] Timeout + worker termination. (3s default; kills + unsubscribes
      on every new compile.)
- [x] Frontend renders result-per-cell in a gutter column (values
      only for now; types arrive in M4).

**M4 — type sidecar + Sigil rendering (2–3 days)**

- [x] Backend launches and supervises a `purs ide server` subprocess
      pointed at a workspace that includes the synthesised module.
      (Lazy-spawned on first compile; killed on backend SIGINT/SIGTERM.)
- [x] After each compile, backend queries `purs ide` for the type of
      each `cell_cN` binding. (Cell ids extracted by regex on the
      synthesised Main.purs we wrote; language-cst-parser remains an
      option for richer identifier handling later.)
- [x] `/session/compile` response extended with `{ types: [{ id, signature }] }`.
- [x] Frontend hands each cell's type string to purescript-sigil and
      renders it in the gutter beside the value.
- [x] Handle the "type not yet known" case gracefully — the frontend
      shows "—" and falls back to the Halogen text node if Sigil can't
      parse the string.

**M5 — error panel, compile-state display (1 day)**

- [x] Errors from `purs` (via the backend) surface in a dedicated
      bottom panel.
- [x] "Compiling…" indicator on the Compile button while a request is
      in flight.
- [x] Last-good values + types stay visible (faded via a
      `.is-compiling` class) while a new compile is pending.

**M6 — MVP polish (1 day)**

- [ ] Keyboard UX: add cell, remove cell, focus next/prev.
      (Deferred — CM6 + inter-cell focus wiring is bigger than MVP
      needs; the buttons do the job for now.)
- [x] Starter content — `Scratch` module with `double` and three cells
      demonstrating liveness + shared scope.
- [x] Deploy recipe — `make start` / `make stop` registered in
      marginalia; `make build` only touches the three workspace
      packages we maintain so stale scratch code can't wedge bootstrap.

**After MVP** — Phase 2 and Phase 2 follow-ups both shipped
2026-04-17/18 (inline errors, hover types, structural values
including records + nullary ctors, Aff support, let-cell toggle,
Tailscale reach). The 2026-04-18 Claude-pair evaluation reset the
horizon: subsequent work is tracked under Phases A–E in "Post-eval
evolution" above, not re-planned here.
